✅ 1. FUNDING UI / BRIDGE ECONOMICS

Your competitors (Echo especially) have a Funding panel:
	•	Fund RC (Reactive) balance
	•	Fund Destination callback proxy
	•	Show how much gas is needed for next message
	•	Show total debt / available balance

You currently have:
❌ No user-facing “funding system” UI
❌ No balance viewer
❌ No “is the Relay funded?” indicator
❌ No automated warnings if destination wallet is empty

Judges LOVE this because it shows:
	•	You understand real-world production constraints
	•	You can visualize operational health
	•	Your app is not just a demo — it’s maintainable

Add a Funding tab → You instantly match Echo + surpass MirrorLink.

✅ 2. BRIDGE MANAGEMENT VIEW

All the top competitors have a “bridge viewer”:
	•	Origin Contract Address
	•	Reactive Contract Address
	•	Destination Proxy Address
	•	Status (Active / Syncing / Failed / Unfunded / Out of Gas)

You list addresses, but you don’t have:

❌ A UI table that shows all feeds + their statuses
❌ Health indicators (green/yellow/red)
❌ Time since last update
❌ Reactive execution log
❌ Bridge settings (decimals, description, last roundId)

This is SUPER attractive to judges because it feels like a real SaaS product.

✅ 3. REACTIVE EXECUTION LOG

You don’t yet show:

❌ A timeline of Reactive executions
❌ Which feed triggered, at what time
❌ Whether the execution succeeded or reverted
❌ Gas used for each execution
❌ Callback tx hash
❌ Event log viewer

Competitors like “Vision” and “Echo” explicitly show execution logs.

✅ 4. SETUP WIZARD (What Echo Has)

Echo has a magic feature:

User picks:
	•	Origin Chain
	•	Feed Address
	•	Destination Chain
	•	Click “Create Bridge”

And the backend auto-deploys:
	•	OriginFeedRelay
	•	ReactiveMirror
	•	DestinationProxy

    B. Auto-Scaling Feed System

You support 3 feeds.

Your competitors support “any feed” with a dropdown → RPC → autodetect decimals + description.

You have:
❌ Hardcoded ETH/BTC/LINK

Add:
	•	Input box → origin address
	•	Autodetect decimals(), description()
	•	Deploy new bridge (even if backend is mock)

And you instantly surpass everyone.
