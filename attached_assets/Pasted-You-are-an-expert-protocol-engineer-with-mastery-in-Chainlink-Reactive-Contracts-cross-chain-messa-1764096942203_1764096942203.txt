You are an expert protocol engineer with mastery in Chainlink, Reactive Contracts, cross-chain messaging, security engineering, and reliability systems. Your task is to design and generate a complete, production-grade, extremely original and unique MOC (Mirror-of-Chainlink) project that mirrors an official Chainlink Price Feed from an origin chain to a destination chain using Reactive Contracts.

THE GOAL:
Build a system that is not just functional, but so elegant, secure, reactive, efficient, and novel that it becomes the strongest submission in the Reactive Bounties competition.

YOUR OUTPUT MUST INCLUDE:

⸻

1. A fully original architecture

Design a reactive architecture that:
	•	uses Reactive Contracts in a truly meaningful and non-obvious way
	•	goes beyond simple event-listening or polling
	•	incorporates fault tolerance, cross-chain validation, state drift detection, or self-healing logic
	•	includes at least one new mechanism or pattern that is uniquely yours

⸻

2. Origin chain logic

Generate:
	•	full smart contract code to read canonical Chainlink price feeds
	•	reactive triggers based on:
	•	NewRound
	•	AnswerUpdated
	•	and optionally predictive heuristics or drift detection
	•	message preparation with:
	•	feed identifier
	•	decimals
	•	description
	•	roundId
	•	answer
	•	updatedAt
	•	domain separator/version
	•	signature and verification model

Make this robust, audited-quality, gas-optimal.

⸻

3. Reactive Contract setup

Produce:
	•	a Reactive Contract that subscribes to multiple conditions
	•	multi-step workflows
	•	failure fallback paths
	•	replay protection
	•	idempotency
	•	optional batching
	•	full JSON/YAML workflow configs
	•	addressable RC deployed example

⸻

4. Destination chain logic

Produce:
	•	a minimal read-only FeedProxy
	•	that stores:
	•	roundId
	•	answer
	•	startedAt
	•	updatedAt
	•	answeredInRound
	•	decimals
	•	description
	•	and exposes:
	•	latestRoundData()
	•	getRoundData()
	•	optional value integrity checks (e.g., stale updates, invalid answers)

Include mitigation for:
	•	chain reorg
	•	delayed messages
	•	replay attack
	•	signature spoofing
